## Overview
For this project, we're exploring the bikesharing data from New York City to try to make a determination on whether or not this is a viable business model for Des Moines.

## Results
### Checkout Times for Users
We can see that the vast majority of trips are under 20 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
Male riders account for about three times as many rides as female riders.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
Mornings and afternoons before and right after work hours seem to be the where the bulk of our rides are made up. The dispersion on the weekends is a little more balanced.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
Males and females seem to ride around the same times.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
Subscribers make up the bulk of our ridership.

## Summary
This model could work in the Des Moines area if there are many people that live within biking distance of their places of work, as those trips seem to make up the bulk of rides. 

In the future, I would like to take a look at the dollars spent per ride. There could be an opportunity to raise the prices in the morning and afternoon before and after work. We could then compare that ridership data to the date before the price increases and see if those increases are sustainable.
